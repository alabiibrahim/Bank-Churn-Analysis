# Project Brief 
Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project objective is to analyze an accident report dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to road safety. It includes trends in accident frequency, locations, times, and causes. The goal is to help improve decision-making and reduce future accidents through data-driven insights.

## Key Questions to Answer

1.	What is the total number of casualties?
2.	What are the total casualties by accidents severities?
3.	Compute the percentage by casualties.
4.	What road condition does accident mostly occurs?
5.	Accident occurs frequently in what light condition?
6.	What road type does accident mostly occurs?
7.	What area does accident mostly occurs?
8.	What weather condition does accident mostly occurs?
9.	What are the casualty rates by junction control?
10.	Compute the number of casualties caused by police force?
11.	How often does accident occurs monthly?
12.	What year has the highest casualties?

## Insights

•	Cars account for the overwhelming majority of casualties (333.5K out of 418K).

•	Motorcycles and vans follow, but at much lower numbers.

•	Most casualties occur on single carriageway roads.

•	Dual carriageways and roundabouts also have notable numbers.

•	Accidents mostly occur during fine weather with no high winds.

•	Around 73% of accidents happen in darkness, suggesting visibility plays a major role.

•	Majority of accidents are slight (85.49%), but serious (13.23%) and fatal (1.28%) still make up a concerning share.

•	November sees the highest monthly casualties, with a gradual decline until February.

•	This may correlate with shorter daylight hours or weather conditions.

•	Urban areas have more casualties than rural areas, likely due to higher traffic density.

•	Most casualties occur at 'Give way or uncontrolled' junctions.

•	Poor or missing data on junction control also contributes to high accident counts.

•	Majority of accidents happen on dry roads, followed by wet or damp surfaces.


## Recommendations

•	Prioritize female customers, older customers, and those in Germany.

•  Tailored retention strategies (loyalty rewards, targeted communication, personal financial advisors).

•  Satisfaction score is average (3.01).

•  Improve service quality, faster resolution of issues, better engagement programs.

•  Since 100% of customers who complain churn, implement a proactive complaint resolution team.

•  Introduce “customer recovery program”: follow-up calls, compensation, service recovery guarantees.

•  Customers with multiple products churn more, suggesting complexity, hidden costs, or dissatisfaction with upselling.

•  Conduct surveys to identify pain points in bundled products and redesign them for transparency & value.

•  Churned customers have higher bank balances ($91k vs $72k).

•  Create a VIP retention program offering premium support, personalized financial advice, and loyalty perks to retain these high-value customers.

•  Germany shows extreme churn (32.4%).

•  Investigate root causes (regulatory issues, competition, dissatisfaction).

•  Launch localized campaigns & offers in Germany to rebuild trust.


## Action Plan

•	Build a “Customer Retention Task Force” to monitor churn signals in real time.

•  Launch a complaint fast-resolution unit (target: 24–48hr resolution).

•  Send personalized retention offers to high-value customers (balance > $80k).

•  Conduct a quick survey targeting Germany, females, and older customers to uncover churn reasons.

•  Improve customer satisfaction by revamping onboarding, support, and communication.

•  Redesign multi-product packages for transparency and customer benefit.

•  Roll out loyalty rewards program for long-tenured customers.

•  Implement predictive churn models using customer data (credit score, tenure, product count, complaints).

•  Expand customer success teams regionally (esp. Germany).

•  Build customer advocacy programs (referrals, community engagement).
